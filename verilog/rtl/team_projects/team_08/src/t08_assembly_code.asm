//TODO: The registers designated in MMIO need to be altered a bit on the hardware level but this will be done later

/*
Catalog of how registers are used: 
    - rs0: Fixed at 0
        - This also serves as the display command for no operation. 
    - rs1: 
    - rs2: 
    - rs3: 
    - rs4: 
    - rs5: 
    - rs6: 
    - rs7: 
    - rs8: 
    - rs9: 
    - rs10: current color
    - rs11: red color
    - rs12: orange color
    - rs13: yellow color
    - rs14: green color
    - rs15: blue color
    - rs16: purple color
    - rs17: pink color
    - rs18: black color
    - rs19: Holds the coordinate input from I2C
    - rs20: Holds the done signal from I2C
    - rs21: I2C address 923923
    - rs22: Fixed at 2A (column address set command hex value)
    - rs23: Fixed at 2B (page address set command hex value)
    - rs24: Fixed at 2C (memory write command hex value)
    - rs25: SPI command address 121212
    - rs26: SPI parameters address 333333
    - rs27: xbus- Used for storing the start and end columns for the display screen for the column address set command
    - rs28: ybus- Used for storing the start and end pages for the display screen for the page address set command
    - rs29: holds 320
    - rs30: Fixed at E1913 (address for coordinate input from I2C) 
        - The I2C done signal will be stored at a location 1 higher (E1914).
    - rs31: Fixed at 1D97C (address for SPI commands) 
        - The parameter count address will be stored at a location 1 higher (1D97D).
        - The parameters address will be stored at a location 2 higher (1D97E).
