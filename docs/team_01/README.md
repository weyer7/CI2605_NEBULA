## Project Overview
Welcome to Tetris! This version of tetris was created by STARS 2025 Team 1 by Cristian, Safa, Mixuan, and Myles. 

This document will go over button layouts, features/hardware, and general gameplay.

## Pin Layout
Note that on the final chip, there are 38 GPIO pins of which you have access to 34.
The first number represents the GPIO on the physical chip, while the second number (in brackets) represents the number in your Verilog code. For each pin, mention if it is an input, output, or both and describe the pin function.

Although we used the ECP5 FPGA for the 2nd half of this project, the layout pins will be in the form of our original ICE40 FPGA.

## External Hardware
VGA BREAKOUT BOARD & CABLE - <img width="1100" height="1100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec0ba27-aaed-40e8-8317-df5e80f49e8e" />

Easy access to wires necessary for display

MONITOR - Compatible VGA Display (needs to support 640 x 480 @ 60 Hz, 25 MHz clock)

SPEAKER  & AMPLIFIER -

The amplifier connects to the speaker and ground and FPGA itself.
For speakers, we used a Logitech z150, but any speaker should work theoretically.

BREADBOARD AND BUTTONS - 
You can wire up the buttons how ever you please. here is our layout we used throughout the design process:

## Functionality Description and Testing
This project is a recreation of Tetris, so all the same rules apply. The best way to test functionality is to wire up buttons and test if inputs are correspond and are valid. 
See presentation for demo video & testbench example [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ5J6eAg-fM0MYb9h2nug7m4cWLqn1QPYuZf28jpfTcCsExHs7RleSBiXM36svMkUjVlpEQlcR1J1pw/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g372a1441054_2_34)

POINT SYSTEM:

1 line - 1 point

2 lines - 3 points

3 lines - 5 points

4 lines (TETRIS) - 8 points


If you get to a point where you spawn a block on another block (reaching the top of the grid), you will reach a GAMEOVER state, you can easily reset to the beginning by pressing the MOVE RIGHT button followed by the PLAYER START button.

Note: If you're at an edge or by a block, you may not be able to rotate. This is by design, as theres a check to see if the next rotation would be valid and not bump into anything. Make some room to rotate :3
